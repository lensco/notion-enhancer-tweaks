# Notion Enhancer Tweaks
Collection of tweaks and user styles for the Desktop version of [Notion](http://notion.so), loaded into [notion-enhancer](https://github.com/notion-enhancer/notion-enhancer). You don't need to run this entire project, you can just get the generated CSS file and load it into notion-enhancer.

Notable changes are
- blue links
- improved highlight colors
- tighter lists with better bullets
- rounded checkboxes
- hiding some `Add â€¦` links
- hiding the `Type "/" for commands` prompt
- truncating long page links
